# Jupyter Report Starter Kit

This repository is a simple starter kit for using Jupyter notebooks
for writing human readable reports.

Though Jupyter notebooks are fantastic for performing ad-hoc analyses
and making research repeatable, it's not a great format for sharing
results with decision makers who may not have the technical expertise
to run a Jupyter notebook and/or understand the code. This starter kit
provides the data scientist with the tools they need to craft
beautiful reports without all the unnecessary code, intermediate
output, etc. that may muddy the report's central message.
